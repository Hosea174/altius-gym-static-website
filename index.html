                Altius Gym is superbly organized and equipped. Professional trainers, top-notch equipment, and a warm,
                welcoming
                atmosphere make it my fitness home. Altius feels like family, and I love every moment spent here. It's
                more than a gym;
                it's a community that's helped me achieve my fitness goals.

              <p>I worked at Altius for 7 to 8 years, weighing 104 kilos. Years ago, Altius was small and didn't have
                much equipment. The
                showers were small and inadequate. The gym closed due to COVID-19, but after reopening, they improved
                the showers and
                everything else. It became really hard to leave Altius Gym. Once you join Altius, you can never work out
                in another gym.
                I tried two gyms after Altius, but it didn't feel like family; it was hard for me. There is no other
                place like Altius.
                Altius is like family to me, from the owner to the cleaners. They are like family. It's a place where
                nobody is treated
                like a stranger.

                This gym is very good. They are committed and focus on you. It's full of workout materials. Group
                classes are my
                favorite. I love how I can come and do my workouts at any time. The gym is very clean, and the sauna and
                steam room are
                also clean. The showers are almost never busy. There is enough parking space. I had an emergency once
                and couldn't come
                for more than 15 days; luckily, they didn't make me pay. All the staff are good. It's very easy here to
                find your lost
                materials.

              <p>Altius has better equipment, and they have improved over the last 3 years. The trainers here are very
                committed. I love
                the staff. I love this gym so much I waited for it to open a new location to join. The trainers assist
                us every day
                without asking for anything. Another thing I love about it is how clean the bathrooms are—no smell,
                everything is super
                clean. Keep it up!

                of seeing the people I train become the best version of themselves physically. This experience has
                translated into my 4
                years of gym training and a year as a level 4 therapist, where I strive to help you conquer your fitness
